🍕 Deep-Dive Pizza Sales Analysis with SQL 🍕

I’m excited to share my recent SQL-based analysis of pizza sales, where I explored sales data to identify customer behavior, peak ordering times, and each pizza's revenue contribution. This project was a great way to apply SQL for extracting key business insights!

Here's a look at what I uncovered:

🕐 Sales by Hour and Quantity:
Analyzed ordering patterns hour-by-hour to discover when customer demand peaks.
Found that evening hours consistently drive the highest sales volume.
Insight: Evening shifts are crucial; extra staff may be needed for rush hours.
📅 Average Pizzas Ordered per Day and Hour:
Measured the average number of pizzas ordered per day and per hour.
Weekend days showed higher orders, with peaks at dinner time.
This analysis can support demand forecasting and inventory planning.
💸 Cumulative Revenue Generated:
Tracked cumulative revenue growth throughout the month.
Identified steady revenue increase on weekends, showing strong demand spikes.
Insight: Enhanced revenue projections and sales goal-setting.
🍕 Revenue Contribution by Pizza Type:
Calculated the percentage of total revenue each pizza type contributes.
Found the top 3 pizzas that contribute most to revenue, as well as underperforming ones.
Actionable insight: Strategic promotions can help drive sales for lower-performing items.
Key Takeaways:
This analysis highlights the power of SQL in transforming raw data into impactful business intelligence.
These insights can support strategic decisions in marketing, operations, and inventory management.
Projects like these fuel my passion for data analytics, and I’m excited to bring this expertise to future roles!
